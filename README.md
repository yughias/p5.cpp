# p5.cpp

## How to use

To compile the projects, just use the makefile provided. Your code should be written in main.cpp files. Just like in P5.js, you can code everything you want inside
the setup() and draw() function. <br/> keyPressed(), keyReleased() and mouseMoved() MUST be implemented, otherwise your code will not compile. If you don't need these
functions, just make an empty implementation (like, keyPressed(){})
